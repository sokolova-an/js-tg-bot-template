## Telegram Bot

This template provides a basic structure for creating a Telegram bot using Node.js and grammy. You can customize the bot's behavior by modifying the `app.js` file.

The `app.js` file contains a basic bot setup that listens for messages and sends a simple response. You can modify this file to add more functionality to your bot.

If you need to add more commands you can do it by adding new file to the 'commands' folder or simple call them from the app.js file.
